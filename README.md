# Insurance-app-mobile-react-native

These two applications have been designed for use by an insurance agency. In particular, there are two versions, one for customers and one for insurers. The customer version allows for the immediate sending of photos, location, and other details of a road accident to their own assessor. The insurer version will provide a list of all road accidents made by customers. The applications were developed using React-Native with the addition of Firebase.
